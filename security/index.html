    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I will be working to assess how secure David Taus' herokuapp site/database--documenting users and their locations--is</p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>......</p>
    <br/>
    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
    <p>This site is somewhat secure, but still has several areas which could use improvement. Users' coordinates cannot be assumed to be true because of the potential for falsified location information</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Issue 1 -- Falsified Location Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Location:</span> in /sendLocation when posting data to the database
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Severity:</span> Medium; data validity is not guarenteed, but not necessarily malicious
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Description:</span> I was able to run curl in terminal and submit false coordinates to the db
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Proof:</span> I couldnt't have been in the middle of the ocean yesterday
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Resolution:</span> Coordinates could be checked (and conformed) using reverse geolocation
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Issue 2 -- Cross-Origin-Access Allowance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Location:</span> in CORS modification: "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*'"
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Severity:</span>medium/high; while our data is not necessarily 'secret', any and everyone can have access to it--with that, if they all decide that they want to recieve the data on our server, our server could get overloaded with requests (which we are not prepaired for)
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Description:</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Proof:</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Resolution:</span> If we cared enough, we could set up a authorization-key system for poeple/organizations that want our data, and only allow them. Or just dont mark as a '*'; be more specific
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Issue 3 -- Cross-Site Scripting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Location:</span> in /sendLocation when posting data to the database
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Severity:</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Description:</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Proof:</span> Go to his site. You can't. You can, however, enjoy the musical stylings of youtube user, with his nice Kazookeylele randition of "The Final Countdown"
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Resolution:</span> check for tag characters '<', '>' and convert them to their 'symbolic' values -- '&lt ;', '&gt ;'
      </li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Issue 4 -- </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Location:</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Severity:</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Description:</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Proof:</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Resolution:</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
