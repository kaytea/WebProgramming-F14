The Google Maps API has been correctly implemented to the best of my knowledge; however, it is not possible to load the MBTA red line data to our domain because the MBTA page has not enabled cross-origin resource sharing.  We cannot share data across different domains unless that property is allowed in the fetched datas' header because of the Same Origin Policy.
