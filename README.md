==Repo Purpose====================
	This is a private repository for my comp20 course work to be stored and graded

==Favorite Assignment=============
	I had the most fun with assignment 1, but the most rewarding assignent for me was the third, because I got to understand how the different 'layers' of the web can all come together and work (& also the security vulnerabilities to be aware of)

==Personal Growth=================
	I've grown SO much over the course of this class. A lot of the skills I think many aquire during the course I sort of figured out over the summer; I certainly got better at HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the general practive of googling my problems away, but that isn't whats going to stick with me.  This class made me excited to learn about the web & gave me the tools to go out on my own and make things(!). I feel like I have gained more perspective with regard to both the industry, and the opportunities within it, and also a greater understanding of what I know, and what I've yet to learn.

==Most Important Thing Learned====
	The things that will stay with me most are how to organize and construct the different 'layers' that go into a web page, and how to use git, homebrew, and other technologies that are good to know in the industry that I would have had a hard time learning on my own.

==Now What========================
	Security, web scraping, data handling... everything! Short term, I want to get better aquainted with the popular frameworks, & more aware of what they have to offer (probably a winter break task), in addition to getting more fluent in python and understanding the necessary tools for getting grithub working and secure.
