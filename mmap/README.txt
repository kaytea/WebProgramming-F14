README - Assignment 2: Marauder's Map

NAME: Kate Wasynczuk (kaytea / kwasyn01)
WORKED WITH: Ming (does that count?)
HOURS SPENT: ~15
IMPLEMENTATION: Character distance can be calculated, but it is not sorted/output to the user (dist. calculation function and assoc. calls have been commented out). Everything else has been correctly implemented to the best of my knowledge.
